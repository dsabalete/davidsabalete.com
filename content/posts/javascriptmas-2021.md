Another year, another JavaScriptmas to solve! This year you can win an annual subscription to Scrimba or 1000$ on December 24th.
For those of you don't know, JavaScriptmas is a challenge run through the first 24 days of December. It's like an Advent Calendar but with javascript problems to solve. See the [launch show here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGLxj14xkNo)
