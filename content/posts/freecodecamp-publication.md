Some years ago I followed some of the Certifications offered for free in this awesome site [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I think that is wonderful to have such great resource for all of the people that want to learn to program and maybe don't have the money for a bootcamp or traditional education.
This initiative is an awesome step forward in order to democratize IT education.
So, that's me, some years later, trying to give back something to this project.
I finally published not one but ~two~ three articles (translations to spanish).
