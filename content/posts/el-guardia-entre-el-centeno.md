It is a novel that describes the experiences of a teenager who does not fit into the world of the time. The action takes place in New York sometime around the 1950s.

This book has caught my attention for a long time. There is like a halo of mystery that surrounds it. It is said that the FBI has had it under control in US libraries. Famous people in history had it as their favorite book.

The book is written as if it were written by a teenager with some kind of psychological problem. The language used is typical of a teenager, with his way of speaking, his repetitive expressions, lack of vocabulary that leads him to repeat things several times, contradictions,...

The truth is that I was surprised. I expected more.
