        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>
            I like to create websites for fun, trying out new technologies and
            tools to improve myself as developer and stay up to date with
            current tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from being a frontend developer, I am a gym goer and enjoy
            training with barbells and iron plates. I also love watching ted
            talks and I also enjoy binge watching films and series on Netflix
            (for improving my english skills ðŸ˜‰).
        </p>
        <p>
            And during the summer, I enjoy go camping with my family near the
            sea.
