Based on my analysis of your portfolio, here are the most impactful content improvements to help you get hired:

## Critical Gaps

1. Add a "Why Hire Me" Hero Section
- Create a concise value proposition (2-3 sentences) above your About section
- Answer: What problems do you solve? What makes you unique?
- Example: "I transform complex technical challenges into scalable, maintainable applications that drive business results"

2. Quantify Achievements in Experience
Currently descriptions list tasks, not results. Add metrics:
- "Improved performance by X%" 
- "Led team of N developers"
- "Reduced build time by X minutes"
- "Launched features that increased user engagement by X%"
- "Reduced technical debt by X%"

3. Create Case Studies for Top 3-5 Projects
Replace simple descriptions with detailed case studies:
- Problem: What business/user problem did you solve?
- Solution: Technical approach and architecture decisions
- Challenges: What was difficult and how you overcame it
- Results: Measurable impact (performance, user experience, business metrics)
- Technologies: Why you chose each tool
- Key Learnings: What you'd do differently

4. Add Testimonials Section
Reach out to 3-5 former colleagues/managers for quotes
- Include their name, role, company, and LinkedIn
- Focus on your technical skills, collaboration, and impact

5. Highlight Open Source Contributions
Create a dedicated section showing:
- GitHub stats (commits, PRs, repositories)
- Notable contributions with links
- Maintenance of community projects
- This demonstrates coding quality and collaboration

6. Create a "Services/What I Do" Section
Before projects, add:
- "Fullstack Application Development"
- "Vue.js/Nuxt.js Architecture & Implementation" 
- "Performance Optimization"
- "Technical Leadership & Mentoring"
- "Legacy System Modernization"

## Medium Priority

7. Consolidate Projects
You have 19 projects - too many. Feature 3-5 best ones prominently:
- Gym Tracker (modern stack)
- Tercer Espai (client work)
- 2-3 other recent, complex projects
Move learning projects (CodePen demos, small tutorials) to a "Learning Journey" section at the bottom.

8. Add Certifications Section
Beyond education, add:
- AWS certifications if you have them
- Google Data Analyst (already in education, move to certifications)
- Any other relevant certs

9. Write 2-3 Technical Blog Posts
Demonstrate expertise with in-depth articles:
- "Architecting Scalable Vue.js Applications"
- "Performance Optimization in Nuxt.js: A Case Study"
- "Migrating Legacy Codebases to Modern Vue 3"
- These showcase deep technical knowledge

10. Add "Speaking/Community" Section
- Conference talks
- Meetup presentations
- Podcast appearances
- FreeCodeCamp publications (already mentioned, expand)


## Low Priority / Nice to Have

11. Better CTA in Contact Section
- "Let's discuss how I can help your team" instead of just social links
- Add email or a contact form for direct inquiries
- Add "Download Resume" button in multiple places

12. Add Awards/Recognition
- Any company awards, hackathon wins, recognition

13. Create a "Tech Radar"
- Show technologies by proficiency level (expert, experienced, learning)
- Visual way to see your depth vs breadth

### Quick Wins (Implement This Week)
1. Rewrite About Section - Add specific achievements
2. Add Metrics to Current Experience - Reach out to former managers if needed
3. Create One Case Study - Pick Gym Tracker as your flagship project
4. Get 2 Testimonials - Send personalized requests today
5. Consolidate to 3 Featured Projects - Move others to "More Projects"
